Drek's Plugin Pack

There is 1 plugin included here.

mod_hldff_ns.php - This plugin is designed specifically for Natural Selection and removes hit location, damage, friendly fire kills and rounds from the stats.  You can activate friendly fire in Natural Selection, but ff kills aren't logged.

Credit goes to Stormtrooper for providing me with the basic code.  I just modified it to suit my purposes.
